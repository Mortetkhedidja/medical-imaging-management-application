This project focuses on the development of a desktop application for managing medical imaging in a neurosurgery clinic. The primary goal is to provide doctors with easy access to patients' medical images and ensure their automatic storage for streamlined record-keeping.

The application is built using the NetBeans 8.2 platform with Java as the programming language, and MySQL as the database management system. It is designed to enhance efficiency and organization in the clinic's imaging workflow by integrating advanced functionalities for image access and secure storage.
